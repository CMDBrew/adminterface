===============================================================================
Depending on your application's configuration, you might need to perform some manual steps:

  1. Change your ActiveAdmin config to use webpacker
   ```
   # config/initializers/active_admin.rb
   # ...
   #
   # == Webpacker
   #
   # By default, Active Admin uses Sprocket's asset pipeline.
   # You can switch to using Webpacker here.
   #
   config.use_webpacker = true
   ```

  2. Migrate your custom javascripts and stylesheets to webpacker
     - app/assets/javascripts/active_admin.js -> app/javascript/packs/active_admin.js
     - app/assets/stylesheets/active_admin.scss -> app/javascript/stylesheets/active_admin.scss

  3. Remove unnecessary sprockets files
     - app/assets/javascripts/active_admin.js
     - app/assets/stylesheets/active_admin.scss
