## How it all started
We first started using ActiveAdmin in 2014 for a client project and were thrilled with the result and the convenience.

Since then we have been experimenting with making different kinds of web applications with it, including internal systems and admin portals. However, the out-of-the-box styles and functionalities were far from ideal for client-facing systems and we ended up doing lots of individual customizations. Ultimately, the process of setting for each project became very repetitive and time-consuming, and hence we decided to build a gem for it.

It may be odd to some developers out there, but we prefer establishing a standard across all of the projects that we have built. This way, projects will be easier to maintain, less prone to errors, easier to test, and have consistent quality.

After years of trials and errors, we have managed to put together the [first open-source public released version](https://adminterface.io/) for others to use. It is now equipped with many [enhanced features and functionalities](https://adminterface.io/docs/enhancements/customizations) based on the widely popular [ActiveAdmin](https://activeadmin.info/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/).

## Why use Adminterface?
Well, we're not going to lie. It's not meant for every type of project out there.  Adminterface was designed for developers or teams that want to achieve:
- having a consistent coding style,
- reducing the need to recreate common features from scratch,
- reducing the time and effort to onboard and train new team members,
- ensuring consistent quality between projects,

and most importantly,
- reducing codebase by at least 40% while shortening the development time so that you can deliver your project faster.

We also believe that the amount of time and trouble Adminterface can save you will lead to higher efficiency and help with the overall budgeting.  Not to mention that we're actively maintaining the gem while constantly listening to feedback from the community.

## Why is it not free all the way?
As we all know, it's not easy to actively maintain open-source projects without any budget. That's why we have a [free Personal Plan](https://adminterface.io/pricing) and a [Commercial Plan](https://adminterface.io/pricing). We're dedicating the subscription fee to maintaining the open-source project so that we could constantly improve it as well as keep it compatible with the latest dependencies.

## What's down the road?
Our team is currently focusing on delivering the gem in its best state and adding the most commonly used features to reduce the amount of repetitive work for developers. We'll be reviewing the first batch of feedback to decide what other features we should implement next, and we would appreciate it if you share your suggestions or feature requests with us on our [Github Discussion](https://github.com/CMDBrew/adminterface/discussions).

Check out our [Installation Guide](https://adminterface.io/docs/start/installation) to get started with Adminterface or visit the [Pricing Page](https://adminterface.io/pricing) to purchase a license.
