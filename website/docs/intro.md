# Introduction
ActiveAdmin Bootstrap brings the best parts of [ActiveAdmin] and [Bootstrap] into your project.

In addition, it is equipped with some of the most commonly used features to help you build any project more efficiently, whether it's internal or customer-facing.

:::info Beta Version
ActiveAdmin Bootstrap is currently under **Closed Beta Development**. [Contact us] if you wish to be an **Early Adopter** and provide us with [feedbacks](https://github.com/CMDBrew/active_admin_bootstrap/discussions). 

‚úåÔ∏è&nbsp;[Stay tuned](/community/support) for our upcoming releases.

## Inspiration
We have been using [ActiveAdmin] for years to build both internal and external products for our customers. This approach helps us establish a standard for building products‚Äî at least for a considerable portion of the project.

However, we need something that is easily customizable and extendable based on our customers' needs. Therefore, we've made a gem to:

- Establish a consistent coding style
- Reduce the need to recreate common features from scratch
- Reduce the time and effort to onboard and train new team members
- Ensure consistent quality between projects

As a result, we were able to **reduce our codebase significantly for each project by at least 40%**, deliver projects much faster, and onboard new members easier, and, at the same time, keep our quality consistent.

After years of experiment and revision, we've decided to release some of the most commonly used features as an open-source project to allow others to benefit from our experience.

We hope you will enjoy using this gem and look forward to hearing your feedbacks! üôå

## Disclaimer
Even though we have been widely using it internally and for our clients, ActiveAdmin Bootstrap is still in **beta and undergoes active development**.

## Design Principles
- **Keep it the same** - This gem extends the functionalities of ActiveAdmin, so all the features within ActiveAdmin should work as expected.
- **Intuitive** - Developers should not feel overwhelmed when looking at the project directory of an ActiveAdmin Bootstrap project. It should look intuitive and easy to build on top of while using familiar approaches.
- **Customizable** - Common components defaults will be provided, but developers should have the options to override them.
- **Not from scratch** - It is not efficient for Developers to be building the same components from scratch for every project.
- **DRY and clean** - Don't repeat yourself and keep codes clean
