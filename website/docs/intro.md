# Introduction
ActiveAdmin Bootstrap brings the best part of [ActiveAdmin] and [Bootstrap] into your project, along with some of the most commonly used features to help you build more efficiently.

With this gem, you can use [ActiveAdmin] for admin panels and other types of projects, whether internal or customer-facing.

## Inspiration
For years we've used [ActiveAdmin] to build both internal and external products for our customers. This approach helps us establish a standard for building products— at least for a considerable portion of the project.

However, we need something that is easily customizable and extendable based on our customers' needs. Therefore, we've made a gem to achieve this. This gem helped us to:
- Establish a standard within the team
- Reduce the need to re-create commonly used features from scratch
- Reduce the time and effort to onboarding and train new team members
- Reduce the work to transfer knowledge
- Ensure our deliverables are up to the same quality
- Ensure our codes are sharable between different projects

And, as a result, we were able to reduce our codebase significantly for each project (~40%), deliver projects much faster, and onboard new members easier, and, at the same time, keep our quality consistent.

After years of experiment and revision, we've decided to release some of the most commonly used features as an open-source project to allow others to benefit from our experience.

We hope you will enjoy using this gem and look forward to hearing your feedback!

## Disclaimer
Even though we have been widely using it internally, ActiveAdmin Bootstrap is still in **beta and undergoes active development**.

We are aiming to release the first stable version this year after gathering the initial batch of feedback.

## Features
- ✅&nbsp; All [ActiveAdmin]'s features
- ✅&nbsp; [Bootstrap]'s styles
- ✅&nbsp; Mobile responsive
- ✅&nbsp; Extended features and customizability
- ✅&nbsp; No more jQuery

## Design Principles
- **Keep it the same** - This gem extends the functionalities of ActiveAdmin, so all features within ActiveAdmin should work as expected.
- **Intuitive** - Developers should not feel overwhelmed when looking at the project directory of an ActiveAdmin Bootstrap project. It should look intuitive and easy to build on top of, using familiar approaches.
- **Customizable** - Common components defaults will be provided, but developers should have the option to override them.
