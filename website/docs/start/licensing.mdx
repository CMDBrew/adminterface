# Licensing
Adminterface is free for personal and non-commercial use and with a yearly subscription for commercial purposes. See [our Terms of Service in full text](/docs/terms) for more information.

:::tip
ðŸ¤— We appreciate your support for purchasing the "Commercial License" plan and help us make Adminterface better.
:::

## Everything's included, always
Every pricing plan will always include all features. There are absolutely no functionality differences with Adminterface's pricing plan.

## One license per project
Each license permits you to run one commercial project in the production environment.

## Purchase a license
We are currently working on the customer's dashboard. But, for now, you can purchase a license from the "Register for the beta" link on https://adminterface.io/pricing.

You will receive a copy of your license key through email after we have confirmed your purchase.

## Add the license key
Create and add the `license_key` into the following file in your project:
```ruby title="config/initializers/adminterface.rb" {2,6,9}
Adminterface.setup do |config|
  config.license_key = "**********************"

  ## Use Rails credentials:
  ## doc: https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/security.html#custom-credentials
  # config.license_key = Rails.application.credentials.adminterface[:license_key]

  ## Or, use environment variables:
  # config.license_key = ENV["ADMINTERFACE_LICENSE_KEY"]
end
```

## License verification
When the application initializes, it pings our server with some information about the current Adminterface installation.
The server will respond with a license valid/invalid back to your application.

:::info
The application will only send the request when it first initializes, so it will not impact your application's performance.

Furthermore, when the verification fails, it won't crash your application, but you will receive a friendly reminder from us.

You can find the full payload below:
```ruby
{
  license_key: license_key, # Your license key
  license: license, # e.g., personal, commerical
  adminterface_version: Adminterface::VERSION,
  rails_version: Rails::VERSION::STRING,
  ruby_version: RUBY_VERSION,
  environment: Rails.env,
  app_name: app_name, # e.g., MyAwesomeProject
}
```
