# Upgrading
We kept the NPM package and the Ruby gem versions in sync. When upgrading, please ensure you update them both.

## Update the Gem
Replace `$VERSION` with the target version.
```ruby title="Gemfile"
gem "adminterface", "$VERSION"
```
And, run:
```bash
bundle install
```

## Update the NPM package
Replace `$VERSION` with the target version, and run:
```bash
yarn upgrade @cmdbrew/adminterface@$VERSION
```
